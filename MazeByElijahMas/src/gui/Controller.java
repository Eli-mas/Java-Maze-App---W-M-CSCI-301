/**
 * <p>Class handles the user interaction:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> It implements an automaton with states for the different stages of the game.</li>
 *     <li> It has state-dependent behavior that controls the display and reacts to key board input from a user.</li> 
 *     <li> At this point user keyboard input is first dealt with a key listener (SimpleKeyListener)
 *          and then handed over to a Controller object by way of the keyDown method.</li>
 *   </ul>
 *
 * <p> The class is part of a state pattern. It has a state object to implement
 * state-dependent behavior. <ol>
 * The automaton currently has 4 states:
 * <li> StateTitle: the starting state where the user can pick the skill-level</li>
 * <li> StateGenerating: the state in which the factory computes the maze to play
 *      and the screen shows a progress bar.</li>
 * <li> StatePlaying: the state in which the user plays the game and
 *      the screen shows the first person view and the map view.</li>
 * <li> StateWinning: the finish screen that shows the winning message.
 *      The class provides a specific method for each possible state transition,
 *      for example switchFromTitleToGenerating contains code to start the maze
 *      generation.</li></ol>
