Steps from http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/29/maze-generation-eller-s-algorithm.html:

STEP 1 -- Initialize the cells of the first row to each exist in their own set.

STEP 2 -- Randomly join adjacent cells, but only if they are not in the same set. When joining adjacent cells, merge the cells of both sets into a single set, indicating that all cells in both sets are now connected (there is a path that connects any two cells in the set).

STEP 3 -- For each set, randomly create vertical connections downward to the next row. Each remaining set must have at least one vertical connection. The cells in the next row thus connected must share the set of the cell above them.

STEP 4 -- Flesh out the next row by putting any remaining cells into their own sets.

STEP 5 -- Repeat until the last row is reached.

STEP 6 -- For the last row, join all adjacent cells that do not share a set, and omit the vertical connections, and you’re done!

subclass Integer with a new class SetInteger with
	fields:
		value: the integer value
		set: reference to the set containing other cells with this value
	methods:
		@Override equals: test equality of value field
		@Override hashCode: return hashCode of value field

create new array SetInteger[width][height]
set first row to unique SetInteger values

get list of all wallboards in last row
for each wallboard:
	if the cells on either side are of different sets:
		get the sets belonging to the two cells
		remove the wallboard from floorplan
		set the cells in both sets to be of one set
