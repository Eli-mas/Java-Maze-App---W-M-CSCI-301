# Java-Maze-App---W-M-CSCI-301

This is a relatively simple desktop maze application written in Java. Derived from refactoring of Paul Fastad's app from 1994, used by permission for educational purposes in the class <CSCI 301: Software Development> at William & Mary.

My personal additions include the files in src/comp, all the test files, as well as other files scattered elsewhere through src, and corresponding javadoc.
